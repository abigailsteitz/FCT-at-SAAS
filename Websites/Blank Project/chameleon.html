  <h2>Things to Know about Chameleons</h2>
  <p>Chameleons change color based on their mood and don't fully develop their color until they reach adulthood (<em>About 5 Months</em>). Since Chameleons live exclusively in trees, their tanks should be big (<em>At least 3 by 3 feet</em>) and have lots of foliage. In addition, make sure their tank is warm because Chameleons thrive in warmer environments. They eat insects, so ensure their diet includes crickets.</p>
