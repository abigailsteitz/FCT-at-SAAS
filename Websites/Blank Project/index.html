        <h2>Rules and Objectives</h2>
        <p><em>Basketball</em> is a team sport where two teams of five players each compete to score points by shooting a ball through the opposing teams hoop, which is mounted 10 feet high. <strong>The main objective</strong> is to score more points than the opponent by the end of four quarters, each typically lasting 12 minutes. Players can move the ball by dribbling or passing, but must follow rules such as not traveling (moving without dribbling) or committing fouls (illegal physical contact). The game emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and skill, with points awarded for field goals (2 or 3 points) and free throws (1 point each).

        <h3>Fun facts</h3>
        <p>Basketball has some fun and surprising facts! It was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who used a soccer ball and peach baskets as goals. The first game ever played had just 13 rules and ended with a score of 1-0. NBA players can jump as high as 40 inches, and the tallest player in NBA history, Gheorghe Mure»ôan, stood at 7 feet 7 inches! Interestingly, slam dunks were once banned in college basketball from 1967 to 1976. Today, basketball is one of the most popular sports worldwide, played in over 200 countries.
