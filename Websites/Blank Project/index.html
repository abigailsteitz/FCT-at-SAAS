    <h2>About Aquarium Design</h2>
    <p>The Aquarium Design for underwater pets is about creating an environment that is super similar to the natural habitat of aquatic animals
      while also making sure the pets needs are met. This includes designing the physical setup, decorations, lighting, plants, filtraton, etc.
      The goal is to make the aquarium look nice and be a healthy place for the pets to live. The design should also be easy to clean and maintain.
      The aquarium should be a safe and comfortable place for the pets to live, with enough space for them to swim and explore. The design should also consider the specific needs of the species being kept.
