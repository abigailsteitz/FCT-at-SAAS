      <h2>2 stars Frank Lee Worst must be fired for this!</h2>
      <p>This cruise was a disappointment. Seeing the milky way was a once in a lifetime moment. The excursions to Mars, Pluto, and the other planets were breathtaking. I only wish literally any other part of the cruise was bearable. Embarrasing maintenance standards. Nuclear waste in the fridge. Daily falling debris in the food court. We started wearing medival armor to lunch to protect our heads. And the horror stories I heard of the "voluntary" experiments were almost unbelievable. Such a shame that such a great idea was squandered. Whoever "Frank Lee Best" is, he needs to be fired and replaced with someone for actual passion for the job. The two stars is ONLY for the milky way</p>
