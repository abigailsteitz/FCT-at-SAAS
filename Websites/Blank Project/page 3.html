      <h2>President and CEO: Frank Lee Best</h2>
      <p>Frank may have been born to work the coolest desk job ever. In his youth, he had several close encounters with various alien species. When their existence became public knowledge, Frank instantly began to think of all the opportunities to get money off of gullible tourists. He established GALACTIC Cruise line as the first of its kind, and it has been replicated many times since. He thanks you for all of your support, because in his own words, he finds the idea of going to space terrifying. He's happy his business venture worked despite vastly prefering his dark and soulless office.</p>

      <h2>Pilot: Max Overdrive</h2>
      <p>After conviction on multiple counts of reckless driving and receiving a whopping 500 speeding tickets, Max feared he might never be allowed to drive again, let alone at a fast speed. However, joining GALACTIC assuaged his concerns. Max thanks GALACTIC for fulfilling his need for speed, and he hopes that all of you enjoy the ride, and furthermore, that no one will get spacesick.</p>
