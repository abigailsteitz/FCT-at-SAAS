    <h1>Octopus</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Octopus page. Here we celebrate the amazing octopus! Here is a shakespearean monologque about octopi. chatgpt wrote it</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>O wondrous beast of ink and endless tide,
        Thy limbs, like tendrils, weave through watery veil,
        A creature born from Poseidon’s deepest side,
        Whose secrets rise where sunlight dares not sail.
        
        What world dost thou inhabit, silent, grim?
        With eyes that gleam like twin moons in the night,
        And skin that shifts from pale to shadow’s brim,
        Thine art, to vanish, as thou take’st flight.
        
        Thou art no mere creature of the deep,
        But master of the dark abyss, so wide.
        Thy cunning mind doth far surpass our sleep,
        And yet thou creep’st in shadows, none can guide.
        
        Thy limbs, like serpents, coil and twist with grace,
        Each one a thread in nature’s secret loom.
        Thy form, a paradox—so vast, yet trace
        No mark of presence save thy sudden doom.
        
        And in thy ink, a tale untold doth swim,
        Of mystery, of darkness, and of fate.
        What strange design compels thee to grow dim,
        To leave no trace, to yield no sign of state?
        
        O octopus, thou phantom of the deep,
        Thine intellect outshines both beast and man.
        In art of flight, in cunning, thou dost leap,
        And trick the eye, with tricks beyond our plan.
        
        Thy life—an enigma wrapped in fluid thread,
        Thy thoughts, like oceans, vast and dark and wide.
        I marvel at thee, yet tremble in my dread—
        For thou dost hold what humankind must hide.</p>
