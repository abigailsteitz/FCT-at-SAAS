# Blank Project

This project is a simple website that showcases unique pets and potted plants available for sale. It consists of two main pages: the homepage and a second page with additional content.

## Files in the Project

- **index copy.html**: This is the main content page of the website. It includes sections for pet options and potted plant options. It has been updated to include a link to the second page.

- **second-page.html**: This file serves as the second page of the website, containing additional information related to the project.

- **main.css**: This file contains the styles for the website. It is linked in the HTML files to apply styles to the elements.

- **app.js**: This file contains JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the website. It is linked in the HTML files to provide behavior.

## How to Use

1. Open `index copy.html` in a web browser to view the main page of the website.
2. Click on the link to navigate to the second page for more information.
